## Building for dev

  1. Run prebuild to build an native app for android and ios. It will create an android and an ios folder.

  ```**shell**
  npm run prebuild
  ```

  For iOS, this will only work on an Apple machine, you will need XCode to compile to an native iOS app:

  ```shell
  npm run ios
  ```

  For Android, you will need android studios to compile to an native android app:
  ```shell
  npm run android
  ```

  2. Crtl + Cmd + z for dev debugging
